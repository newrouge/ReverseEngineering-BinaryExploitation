# ReverseEngineering-BinaryExploitation
While leraning this new skill i want to doucment everything each tool, resource, talk, book etc. refernced while i will also write my own blog to put my learning into words. 

## Day 1
*Finding from where to learn stuff found some awesome stuffs, after consuming some content evryone was talking about **Heap** & **stack**. I had rough idea but what exactly are they and how are they relevant to RE/BE?*

### Stack vs Heap

+ Each process on initiating gets its own set of stack and heap.
+ stack is assigned to simple variables(static memory allocation) while heap is for more complex objects which consist of different variables or u can say dynamic memory allocation.
+ upon completion or as soon as variable goes out of scope stack is cleared but heap remains same unless programmer deallocates memory manually, but modern programs have garbage collectors for that task.
+ They both reside in RAM(not physically) just a portion of memory which is used for doing the task.

**You should give following articles a read yourself for better understanding**
