# ReverseEngineering-BinaryExploitation
While leraning this new skill i want to doucment everything each tool, resource, talk, book etc. refernced while i will also write my own blog to put my learning into words. 

## Day 1
*Finding from where to learn stuff found some awesome stuffs, after consuming some content evryone was talking about **Heap** & **stack**. I had rough idea but what exactly are they and how are they relevant to RE/BE?*

### Stack vs Heap

+ Each process on initiating gets its own set of stack and heap.
+ stack is assigned to simple variables(static memory allocation) while heap is for more complex objects which consist of different variables or u can say dynamic memory allocation.
+ upon completion or as soon as variable goes out of scope stack is cleared but heap remains same unless programmer deallocates memory manually, but modern programs have garbage collectors for that task.
+ They both reside in RAM(not physically) just a portion of memory which is used for doing the task.

**You should give following articles a read yourself for better understanding**

## Day 2
*Understading Assembly Language*

### Assembly language: 
+ Reading this [blog](https://www.intezer.com/blog/malware-analysis/malware-reverse-engineering-beginners/) 
+ What are registers these are like variables used in assembly language to store values or point to different locations in stack.
+ one thing that did hold me for few hours why every program starts & end with fixed assem. code i.e. **prologue** and **epilogue**.

#### Prologue: 
 *when a fucntion is called prologue creates the stack frame for that function, e.g when an add function is called in main function a stack frame will be created for add function*
```
push pbp
move ebp, esp
```  

#### Epilogue:
*When an function ends and need to be returned to main function it was called in. stack frame need to cleard and epilogue is responsible for that*

```
move esp, ebp
pop ebp
ret
``` 
+ when stack frame is created prologue set ESP(current stack pointer) & EBP(current base pointer), where ebp remebers the current location, one after the return address, and esp keep changing through out the function.
+ when function ends esp is reset to ebp by epilogue and pops the ebp which points the current stack pointer to return address and function successfully return to main fucntion.
+ ofcourse all of it was not so clear on simply reading the blog so i had to google and found this 3 part series watch this.

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31206192/does-the-stack-automatically-get-popped-when-leaving-a-function-in-x86-nasm-asse

+ Learned about how different things work like high meory low memory, 4 bytes difference etc. just read the blog you will get it.'
